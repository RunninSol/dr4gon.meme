## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option A: GitHub + Railway (Recommended)

1. **Initialize Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Dr4gon.meme"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Repository**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Create a new repository
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

3. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dr4gon-meme.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Deploy to Railway**
   - Visit https://railway.app/new
   - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway will auto-detect Next.js and deploy
   - Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

5. **Generate Domain**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Your site will be live at `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Option B: Railway CLI

1. **Install CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize & Deploy**
   ```bash
   railway init
   railway up
   railway domain
   ```

- [ ] Animations smooth
- [ ] Mobile responsive

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Fails
**Solution**: Check Railway logs, ensure all dependencies in `package.json`

### Issue: Static Assets 404
**Solution**: Verify files in `/public` directory, paths start with `/`

### Issue: SSE Logs Not Streaming
**Solution**: Check Railway logs, verify `/api/tee-logs-ws` endpoint, ensure headers configured

### Issue: Logo Not Displaying
**Solution**: Confirm `public/images/pfpdr4gon.png` exists and pushed to repo

### Issue: App Crashes on Start
**Solution**: Check Railway logs for errors, verify `npm run start` works locally
